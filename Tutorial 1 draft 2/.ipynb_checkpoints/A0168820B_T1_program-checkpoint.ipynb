    "### 5.1 What if features are continuous?\n",
    "\n",
    "If the features are continuous, we will not be able to effectively use decision trees, as they are more suitable for dealing with categorical variables. Some alternatives would be to either use the nearest neighbour classification, regression methods, or neural nets (e.g. for time series). On the other hand, if we want to still use decision trees, we would need to discretize the continuous attributes. \n",
    "\n",
    "One way to do this would be to assign buckets (e.g. weights from 0-10, 10-20 etc…). This falls under global discretization, and the resultant categorical variable can be treated as a new label regardless of the choice of our data mining algorithm. However, one drawback of this is that the data loses its meaning and out predictions are the buckets instead of the actual values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to still carry out decision tree classification would be to perform local discretisation. This involves turning the continuous dataset into a series of binary outputs, such as for heights, H < v1, H < v2, H < v3 etc.. and choosing the split which maximizes information gain. The drawback of this is that it can be computationally expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.2 What if output is continuous? \n",
    "\n",
    "If the output is continuous, then one solution would be to build a regression tree. In this process, we choose a predictor and a cutpoint, and partition the space such that the loss is minimized. A simple way to measure loss is to calculate the residual sum of squares (RSS). \n",
    "\n",
    "After obtaining this predictor and cutpoint, we recursively perform binary splitting on one of the 2 spaces and stop when some pre-defined termination condition is satisfied."
